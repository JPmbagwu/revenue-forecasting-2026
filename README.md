# revenue-forecasting-2026
Built and presented a 2026 revenue forecast model, including methodology, assumptions, scenarios, and executive recommendations.

# Revenue Forecast 2026 Presentation

## Project Overview
Developed a comprehensive revenue forecast for 2026, using historical data and modeling techniques to project future performance. Presented findings in a clear, executive-friendly deck to inform budgeting, planning, and strategic decisions.

## Challenge
Leadership needed reliable projections for the upcoming year amid uncertainty (e.g., market trends, seasonality, economic factors). Past forecasts were either too simplistic or not well-visualized, making it hard for non-technical stakeholders to act on them.

## What I Did
- Gathered and cleaned historical revenue data (sales, trends, external drivers).
- Built forecasting models (e.g., time series analysis, regression, or scenario-based—what you actually used!).
- Incorporated key assumptions (growth rates, seasonality, risks) and ran sensitivity/scenario analyses (base, optimistic, pessimistic).
- Validated the model (e.g., backtesting on prior years, error metrics like MAE/MAPE).
- Designed a professional presentation deck:
  - Key slides on methodology, projections, visuals (charts, graphs, tables).
  - Highlighted drivers, risks, and actionable recommendations.
- Tailored content for management audience—focused on insights over raw math.
- Used [Python] for modeling—scripts.

## Impact
- Provided leadership with data-driven projections to guide 2026 budgeting and resource allocation.
- Highlighted potential upside/risks, enabling proactive strategies (e.g., identifying growth opportunities or cost-saving areas).
- Improved decision-making confidence—stakeholders could easily understand and discuss the forecast.
- Supported cross-functional planning (e.g., informed marketing spends, hiring, or investments).
- If measurable: Helped achieve more accurate budgeting or contributed to X% growth alignment.

## Skills & Tools
- Forecasting techniques (time series, regression, scenario modeling)
- Data analysis & validation
- Visualization & storytelling (charts, dashboards)
- Executive communication
- Tools: [Python (pandas, statsmodels, Prophet?), PowerPoint/Google Slides, etc.]
